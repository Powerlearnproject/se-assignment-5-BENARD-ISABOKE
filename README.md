   Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has built-in support for Git, which makes it easy to manage source control directly from the editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Git, initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.

Prerequisites
Git Installation: Ensure Git is installed on your computer. You can download and install it from git-scm.com.
GitHub Account: You should have a GitHub account. If not, you can create one at github.com.
Initializing a Repository
Open Project in VS Code:

Open your project folder in VS Code using File > Open Folder....
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
Click the Initialize Repository button.
This action creates a new Git repository in your project folder and adds a .git folder to the directory.
Making Commits
Stage Changes:

After making changes to your files, go to the Source Control view.
You will see a list of files with changes. Click the plus icon (+) next to each file to stage it. You can also click the plus icon (+) at the top to stage all changes.
Commit Changes:

After staging the changes, enter a commit message in the text box above the changes list.
Click the checkmark icon (✓) or press Ctrl+Enter to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub
Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Note the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).
Add Remote Repository:

Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+` (backtick) or selecting Terminal > New Terminal.
Add the remote repository URL by running the following command in the terminal:
sh
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Verify the remote by running:
sh
Copy code
git remote -v
Push Changes:

To push your local commits to the remote repository, use the following command in the terminal:
sh
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes the master branch to the origin remote repository. The -u flag sets the upstream for the master branch, so you can use git push alone for future pushes.
Summary of Commands
Initialize Git Repository:

sh
Copy code
git init
Add Remote Repository:

sh
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Stage Changes:

sh
Copy code
git add .
Commit Changes:

sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push Changes:

sh
Copy code
git push -u origin master
